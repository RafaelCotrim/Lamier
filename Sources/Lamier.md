# Lamier

Lamier is a world of flooded dunes and caves. Although the surface contains large amounts of liquid water, the Black Storm sweeps the world periodically, killing most forms of life. Because of that, all inhabitants of the planet have fled to the World Caves and the entrances to the surface have been permanently sealed.

## History

Most of the history of Lamier has been lost to its inhabitants. It has been more than 10.000 years since the surface was last occupied and the survivors live below the ground under the belief that the whole world is made of the eternal caves that surround them.

However, as they develop their technology, many of their assumptions about the world are being challenged.

### Calm Before the Storm

Before the black clouds that follow the months were created, the planet was inhabited by almost a billion people from many different races. The most powerful nations were located near the poles and used the power of the auroras to perform great feats. This lost form of magic, Fatespeak, remains the most powerful ever created.

Magic was reserved to the elite, who bent nature to their will. Powerful star readers were able to terraform large sections of land, removing mountains and creating places for cities. Life expectancy was also growing fast. Nobles often lived more than 200 years with the aid of magic and the common folk were slowly able to access similar, if weaker and less expensive, medical advances.

### The Clouds on the Horizon

However, this golden age was built on the backs of the Steorra, the people of the stars. The Steorra were the original magic users and their civilization was composed of small nomad groups that traveled the polar regions. Although individually powerful, they didn't have the numbers to combat the ceaseless attacks of the other nations.
After being captured they were forced to share their secrets, teaching the basics of magic to their captors.

Although the other races had gained the knowledge of how to read the stars, they had great difficulty controlling the auroras. To do so they require the use of catalysts which often were the Steorra themselves. They finally discovered what was missing after the first half Steorra children grew up and inherited their parent's powers. After that, some nobles had children with the Steorra in secret and their offspring created some of the longest-lasting empires. Eventually, these bloodlines spread through all major noble families.

Still, the majority of the Steorra were kept in captivity and farmed like cattle. After other forms of magic were discovered, their use as catalysts on the construction of spells or reactions grew exponentially, which often had fatal results. As a result, they became highly valuable commodities.

### Overpowering Hatred

The Black Winds were created as a curse by the most powerful Steorra, the Storm Mother. She was part of a small group that was able to remain hidden for generations after fleeing to the middle of a desert. However, this arrangement was not meant to last. Her group was eventually tracked down and killed. She was the only one able to escape.

She ran away to the south and found one of the many hidden temples her people had built. There she hid and continued to develop her powers. Aided by the scriptures carved on the walls of the temple and tempered time, her fear and sorrow morphed into an all-consuming rage that fulled powerful incantation never seen before. 



After many years, she continued south and attacked many cities along the way, imprisoning the souls of the inhabitants. She used these souls as a catalyst in the south pole to create the strongest spell ever devised.

##### Forgotten Archon

If the Storm Mother's story were known to the inhabitants of the underground, she would likely be considered the first Archon, taking the title from Oucho, The Protector.

The 25 000 souls she collected formed a vortex below the auroras and covered the sky in black clouds. The storm embodied her rage and hate. It consumed the auroras and started expanding north, killing everything in its way. She gave her life to cast the spell, becoming part of the growing calamity.

### Refuge Bellow

Seeing the disaster coming, 9 nations came together to perform the largest terrain manipulation ever attempted. Hundreds of star readers excavated deep caves and created crystal pilar that went from the ceiling of the caves to above the clouds. These would transport light to the underground.

Millions of people fled into the caves and passages were closed as the storm approached. The Storm Mother, seeing that she would not be able to kill everyone before they sealed off the last entrance, filled the bodies of 50 dead people with her magic. They became her puppets and she sent them with the last refugees. Once all the entrances were sealed, she released her magic from inside.

Although she was not able to store enough magic in the bodies to kill everyone or break the seal, she was able to create another curse. She wiped the memory of everyone inside the caves in the hope that they would break the seals someday, allowing her to enter and finish her work. She now periodically searches the whole planet, looking for a way to get inside.

### Ethernal Storm

The Storm Mother is so methodical in her work that all animals and plants have been completely eradicated from the surface, including the ones that live deep in the oceans. She has poisoned the waters and eroded the mountains. The erosion covered vast areas of the surface with coarse sand dunes. These dunes are flooded regularly by the periodic rains and the algae that live there serve as the last bastion of life on the surface. The poles still suffer under a perpetual storm that draws power from the auroras. The only things capable o surviving her wrath were the crystal pillars now known as Luminars.
